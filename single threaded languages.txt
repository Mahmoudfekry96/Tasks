JavaScript:
 Primarily used for web development, JavaScript operates on a single-threaded event loop,
 meaning it processes one task at a time. This is true for client-side JavaScript running in browsers.

Python (default implementation - CPython):
 While Python has support for threading, 
the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. Thus,
 it can be considered single-threaded in many contexts.

Ruby:
 Similar to Python, Ruby's standard implementation (MRI) uses a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL),
 making it effectively single-threaded for CPU-bound operations.

Lua: 
Lua is a lightweight scripting language that is single-threaded by default. 
It is often embedded in applications to provide scripting capabilities.

PHP: 
Although PHP can be used in multi-threaded web servers like Apache with the appropriate configuration,
 PHP itself is traditionally single-threaded. Each request to a PHP script runs in its own process.
